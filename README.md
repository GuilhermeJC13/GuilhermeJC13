# About myself

Hello, my name is Guilherme and I'm from Brazil. I'm a Computer Engineering student at UFPB and have been focusing my studies on entrepreneurship, software engineering/algorithms, Data engineer and Artificial Intelligence. I have experience in wearing multiple hats, working in a startup environment. I have a lot of leadership expertise, having successfully led TAIL (Technology and Artificial Intelligence League), closed many partnerships with important organizations such as the fire force and the Brazilian Paralympic Committee and significantly reduced the dropout rate in the league, and founded a Startup study group. As well, I love to immerse myself in the entrepreneurial environment and have built multiple products.
